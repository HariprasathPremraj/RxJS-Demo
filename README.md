# RxJS_Demo
This demo requires Node JS and Typescript to be installed.

RxJS has been added as dependency in package.json
Apart from that we have dev dependency on webpack

In the webpack config file, we have specified the entry file. In our index.html we have added reference for app.js. 
If you want to refer to a new file, you can change the entry parameter in webpack config file.

This code base would be extended to show demo on how to use RxJS in SharePoint context.
